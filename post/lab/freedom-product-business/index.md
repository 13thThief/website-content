The small online business 100% owned by an individual, without fixed costs, no warehouse, no employees, no office, no obligation to be at some time in a certain place, no meetings, no conference calls, is the best life that exists in the world. And itâ€™s the closest thing to complete freedom.

By running an online business, for example, you may decide to leave tomorrow for a month and explore remote Alaska or New Zealand, and nothing in the business is turned off. No email must be sent to the customers to inform you of your trip, no email auto-responders "I'm out of office", because the business can - depending on the case - be 100% automated or in any case carried on according to your time. You keep control of the situation.

If you are a freelancer and you have only one customer, what you actually have is a boss, while if you are a freelancer and you have 5 clients, you have 5 bosses.

However, if you sell a digital product at a mid-low price, say below 100$, to many customers, then you have control, and none of these customers will ever think they can claim your attention when they want or call you on the phone or ask for a meeting because no one will think they have any rights on your time.
