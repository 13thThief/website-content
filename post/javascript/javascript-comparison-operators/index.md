You can use the following operators to compare two numbers, or two strings.

The operation returns a boolean.

- `<` less than
- `<=` minus than, or equal to
- `>` greater than
- `>=` greater than, or equal to

```js
const a = 2
a >= 1 //true
```

When comparing strings, those operators check for the letter ordering, encoded in Unicode. The bigger the letter value, the bigger the letter is to the operator when comparing.

You can find the [list of Unicode Codes for characters on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters).
