Operators allow you to get one or more simple expressions and combine them to form a more complex expression.

We can classify operators based on the operands they work with. An operand is a simple expression.

Some operators work with 1 operand:

- Increment (`++`)
- Decrement (`--`)
- Unary negation (`-`)
- Unary plus (`+`)
- Logical not (`!`)
- `new`
- `delete`
- [`typeof`](/javascript-typeof-operator/)
- [`await`](/javascript-async-await/)
- The [spread operator](/javascript-spread-operator/)

Most with 2 operands:

- Addition (`+`)
- Subtraction (-)
- Division (/)
- Remainder (%)
- Multiplication (*)
- Exponentiation (**)
- Assignment (=)
- [Comparison operators](/javascript-comparison-operators/) (`<`, `<=` etc)
- [Equality checks](/javascript-equality-operators/) (`==`, `!==` etc)
- [Logical `and` and `or`](/javascript-logical-operators/)
- [`instanceof`](/javascript-instanceof-operator/)
- [`in`](/javascript-in-operator/)

Just one operator works with 3 operands: the [ternary operator](/javascript-ternary-operator/).
