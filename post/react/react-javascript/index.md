If you are willing to learn React, you first need to have a few things under your belt. There are some prerequisite technologies you have to be familiar with, in particular related to some of the more recent JavaScript features you'll use over and over in React.

Sometimes people think one particular feature is provided by React, but instead it's just modern JavaScript syntax.

There is no point in being an expert in those topics right away, but the more you dive into React, the more you'll need to master those.

I will mention a list of things, with pointers to articles I wrote that can help you get up to speed quickly:
