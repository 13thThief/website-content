React is a [JavaScript](/javascript/) library that aims to simplify development of visual interfaces.

Developed at Facebook and released to the world in 2013, it drives some of the most widely used apps, powering Facebook and Instagram among many other applications.

Its primary goal is to make it easy to reason about an interface and its state in any point in time, by dividing the UI into a collection of components.

React is used to build single-page web applications.

I wrote a number of resources and tutorials on this blog related to React.

I collected them all in the React Handbook, a handy free resource [you can download on this page](/page/ebooks/).
