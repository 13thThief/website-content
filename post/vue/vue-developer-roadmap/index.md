I found out the [React Developer Roadmap](https://github.com/adam-golab/react-developer-roadmap) on the web, and I decided to make one for Vue.

![Vue Developer Roadmap](roadmap.svg)

To be a proficient Vue.js developer, you need to learn:

1. the basics of how the Web works
2. HTML, [CSS](/css/)
3. the [DOM](/dom/)
4. how browsers work
5. the [JavaScript basics](/javascript/), [event handling](/javascript-events/), the newest [ES6-7-8](/ecmascript/) features
6. [Git](/git/)
7. how to use the terminal
8. [the Vue basics](https://vuehandbook.com)
9. [webpack](/webpack/)
10. how to install packages using [npm](/npm/) or [yarn](/yarn/)
11. how to run tasks using npm scripts
12. CSS modern tools: SASS, [PostCSS](/postcss/)
13. a CSS framework like Tailwind or Bootstrap or another
14. how to use CSS in JS using Single File Components
15. how to manage state using component state or [vuex](/vuex/), and its libraries
16. how to check types using prop types or [TypeScript](/typescript/)
17. how to handle routing using [vue-router](/vue-router/)
18. how to consume APIs using [GraphQL](/graphql/)/[Apollo](/apollo/)/REST using [axios](/axios/) or [fetch](/fetch-api/)
19. use an utility library like lodash or moment
20. how to test using [Jest](/jest/) and the [Vue Test Utils](https://vue-test-utils.vuejs.org)
21. how to perform end to end testing using Cypress or Puppeteer or others
22. how to build a desktop Vue app using [Electron](/electron/)
23. how to internationalize an app using [`vue-i18n`](https://github.com/kazupon/vue-i18n)
24. how to implement server-side rendering

The list could grow indefinitely, but those are the basics of a well-rounded Vue developer ðŸ˜‡

I wrote about all of this in the Vue Handbook, a handy free resource [you can download on this page](/page/ebooks/).
