CSS is an amazing tool, and in the last few years it has grown a lot, introducing many absolutely fantastic features, like CSS Grid, Flexbox and CSS Variables.

Before you check out those cool features, take a step back and inspect the CSS basics through my [introduction to CSS](/css-introduction/) post.

Here are some more advanced topics regarding the modern layout construction in CSS:

- [Flexbox](/flexbox/)
- [CSS Grid](/css-grid/)

Sometimes there are things you think you know, but when it comes to implementing, they are a bit confusing, especially if you start searching online, where you can really find anything:

- [Centering with CSS](/css-centering/)
- [The CSS margin property](/css-margin/)

Variables is a huge topic, one that could make CSS be very close to SCSS and the other preprocessors:

- [CSS Variables](/css-variables/)

Now, animations. Animations are huge. CSS animations are the best way to perform simple animations. More complex things need to be done using JavaScript, but CSS is so powerful! Check out

- [CSS Transitions](/css-transitions/)
- [CSS Animations](/css-animations/)

CSS is huge on displays, but it's also huge for printing documents. Check out [how to use CSS for print](/css-printing/) if you're interested.

Web Fonts are another big topic. My [CSS System Fonts](/css-system-fonts/) article sheds some light on using system fonts and avoid loading unnecessary bits of data if you don't strictly need them.
