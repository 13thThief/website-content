While building the [React Handbook](https://reacthandbook.com) landing page, I had to search how to rotate an image. I wanted to rotate an [SVG](/svg/) image, but this works for any image type. Or any HTML element, actually.

Add this CSS instruction to the element you want to rotate:

```css
animation: rotation 2s infinite linear;
```

You can also choose to add a `rotate` class to an element, instead of targeting it directly:

```css
.rotate {
  animation: rotation 2s infinite linear;
}
```

tweak the `2s` to slow down or speed up the rotation period.

Then add this line, outside of any selector:

```css
@keyframes rotation {
  from {
    transform: rotate(0deg);
  }
  to {
    transform: rotate(359deg);
  }
}
```

That's it! Your elements should now rotate.
