Thanks to Algolia, which powers the search, I noticed many searches for Angular and related topics.

I haven't written about Angular yet, but I plan to do it soon, so feel free to jump on the newsletter in the homepage to be alerted when I start writing about it!

Currently focused on React though, which might be something of interest to you too.

Sorry if this was not what you expected! Coming soon ðŸ˜€
