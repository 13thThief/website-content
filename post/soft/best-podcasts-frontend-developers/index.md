I am a happy podcast listener. I listen to podcasts when I go walking the dog for an hour, when doing some solo trekking, when driving.

It's a great way not only to learn new things, but to hear stories and widen your horizons.

I have a list of podcasts I listen to, but I won't annoy you with that. Instead I want to list what I think are the best podcasts for frontend developers.

If you are looking forward expanding your podcast catalog, here's a good place!
