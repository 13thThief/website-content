Often used along with [the `img` tag](/html-img-tag/) is the `figure` tag.

`figure` is a semantic tag often used when you want to display an image with a caption. You use it like this:

```html
<figure>
    <img src="dog.png"
         alt="A nice dog">
    <figcaption>A nice dog</figcaption>
</figure>
```

The `figcaption` tag wraps the caption text.
