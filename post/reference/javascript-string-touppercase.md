Return a new string with the text all in upper case.

Does not mutate the original string.

Does not accept any parameter.

Usage:

```js
'Testing'.toUpperCase() //'TESTING'
```

If you pass an empty string, it returns an empty string.

It's similar to [`toLocaleUpperCase()`](/javascript-string-tolocaleuppercase/), but does not consider locales at all.
