Return a new string with the text all in lower case.

Does not mutate the original string.

Does not accept any parameter.

Usage:

```js
'Testing'.toLowerCase() //'testing'
```

Works similarly to [`toLocaleLowerCase()`](/javascript-string-tolocalelowercase/), but does not consider locales at all.
